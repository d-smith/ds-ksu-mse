==========
Code for my KSU MSE program. Note the goal of the code was to produce an architecture simulation for testing
a replicated caching solution for a system that reads metadata from a database to determine how to process
a workflow transaction.

Refer to the [project website](http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~dougs/Site/Welcome.html) for 
more information and artifacts related to the project.
