Data access objects used to encapsulate access to the database.
<p>Data access is done using the Hibernate object/releational mapping system. DAOs are only
used via Hazelcast backing stores, such that reads are performed against the IMDG, with
the IMDG accessing the database on cache misses. Writes are done asynchronously via Hazelcast
backing store classes that use the DAOs to write data.</p>
