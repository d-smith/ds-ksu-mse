Hazelcast collection load and store implementations.
<p>For loading and storing data in a database behind the IMDG, Hazelcast defines two interfaces 
(Loader and Store) which are used to plug in data access. The classes in this package provide
database interaction in the context of IMDG reads and writes. Access is done via Hibernate,
based on mapping files and using objects in the domain package to represent persistent data.</p>
